following github tutorial

Hi Class and other Followers!
I am interested in learning R and re-explore Python in the very near future. I currently work with VBA in Excel and a bit in Access to perform data analysis for a proteomics lab! Currently I am following the GitHub tutorial alongside my Coursera class.
